# StaticSite

Static site generator using a common sense DSL

## TODO

* ~~Create DSL parser that outputs HTML~~
* ~~Update personal site to use better CSS/JS (more linked, less inline)~~
* ~~Create file watcher service that can watch directories and filter on file types~~
* ~~Service encapsulated in single JAR file~~
* ~~Any changes to DSL files generates new HTML files~~
* Create web server that will serve up HTML and any required assets
* Any changes to linked assets (CSS, JS) generates new compressed files
* Localhost automatically refreshes page on any changes

## Ideas

* ~~More checking for path existence in watcher, use of exception handling~~
* Robots.txt
* Blog
* Site index
* Keywords
